# 4: Analysis
In the section, we will perform the analysis we discussed above. 

## Pre-modeling Data Processing
We will first perform two major processing steps before the modeling process:
* convert factors into dummy variables
    + By transforming the categorizal variables into dummy variables, we may be able to use R's built-in function *glmnet* to fit the data.
* mean centering and standardization
    + By centering and Standardizing the data, we may have comparable scales so that the coefficients would function properly.


## Ordinary Least Squares Regression
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
load('../../data/')
```


## Ridge Regression

## Lasso Regression

## Principal Components Regression

## Partial Least Squares Regression
