# 5: Results

    In this section we will compare Principal Components Regression with Partial Least Squares Regression and Lasso Regression with Ridge Regression because of the similarities in each pairwise set of regression methods.
    
## PCR and PLSR

    Below are the plots for cross-validation for PCR and PLSR. They compare the number of components used to the cross-validation MSE (MSEP).
