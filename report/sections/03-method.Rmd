# 3:Method
The methods that we are evaluating for this project include two Shrinkage Methods, *Ridge Regression* and *Lasso Regression*, and two Dimension Reduction Methods, *Principal Components Regression* and *Partial Least Squares Regression.* We also have the *Ordinary Least Squares Regression* as the benchmark to compare the models.

### Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS)
Ordinary Least Squares Regression is a method for estiamting the unknow parameters in a linear regression model, with the goal of minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed responses in the given dataset and those predicted by a linear function of a set of explanatory variables. 

## Shrinkage Methods:
Shrinkage Methods are devoted to constrain or regularize the coefficients estimates, or equivalently, shrink the coefficient estiamtes towards zero when fitting a model containning all predictors. By shrinking the coefficient estimates, the model could significantly reduce the variance in predictions. The two best-known techniques for shrinking the regression coeffcients towards zero are *Ridge Regression* and *Lasso Regression*, both of which we would discuss in the following sections.

### Ridge Regression (RR)

### Lasso Regression (LR)

## Dimension Reduction Methods:

### Principal Components Regression (PCR)

### Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
