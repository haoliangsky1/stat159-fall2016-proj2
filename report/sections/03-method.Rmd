# 3:Method
The methods that we are evaluating for this project include two Shrinkage Methods, *Ridge Regression* and *Lasso Regression*, and two Dimension Reduction Methods, *Principal Components Regression* and *Partial Least Squares Regression.* We also have the *Ordinary Least Squares Regression* as the benchmark to compare the models.

## Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS)
Ordinary Least S

## Ridge Regression (RR)

## Lasso Regression (LR)

## Principal Components Regression (PCR)

## Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
