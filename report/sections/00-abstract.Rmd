This project is largely based on Chapter 6 of **Linear Model Selection and Regularization** (From "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James et al.). The primary idea of this project is to perform a predictive modeling process applied on the data set Credit. We will be considering *Ridge Regression (RR)*, *Lasso Regression (LR)*, *Principal Components Regression (PCR)*, and *Partial Least Squares REgression (PLSR)*, and training them using cross-validation. We evaluate the best model by their Minium Square Erros on the test sets.
