This is the description of all the data files needed or generated by this project.

Firstly, we have the *Credit.csv*, which can be accessed through [this link](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv). This data set comes from the [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html) book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Without their help, this project would never be possible.

We also have the *scaled-credit.csv* data set, which is the previous data set with standardization and centralization.

From this data set, we always use randomization methods to generate two data sets, the *trainingSet.csv* and *testSet.csv*, with a randomization seed of 1. Any one with access to this project could reset their seed by modifying the *Make* file.

Additionally, we also have a *trainingIndex.RData* file, which stores the entry index of the training set, to simplify the data input during model training.

The *correlation-matrix.RData* is a R data file that stores the correlation matrix between all the quantitative variables in the *Credit* data set, including *Income*, *Limit*, *Rating*, *Cards*, *Age*, *Education*, and the dependent response variable *Balance*. This data can also be used to plot the correlation matrix.

The *eda-correlationMatrix.txt* is the plain text file of the correlation matrix mentioned above.


The *eda-summaryMatrix.RData* file and *eda-quantitativeVariables.txt* file store the summary statistics of all the quantitative variables, including their *Mimnimum*, *Maximum*, *Range*, *Median*, *First and Third Quartiles*, *Interquartile Range*, *Mean*, and *Standard Deviation*.

The *frequencyTable-ethnicity.RData* file and *frequencyTable-ethnicity.txt* file both store the frequency table, including counts and relative frequency, for the qualitative variable *Ethnicity*.

The *frequencyTable-gender.RData* file and *frequencyTable-gender.txt* file both store the frequency table, including counts and relative frequency, for the qualitative variable *Gender*.

The *frequencyTable-married.RData* file and *frequencyTable-married.txt* file both store the frequency table, including counts and relative frequency, for the qualitative variable *Married*.

The *frequencyTable-student.RData* file and *frequencyTable-student.txt* file both store the frequency table, including counts and relative frequency, for the qualitative variable *Student*.

The *regressionPCR-cvResult.RData* file stores the information of the Principal Component Regression model trained via cross-validation, with the randomization seed of 1.

The *regressionRR-cvResult.RData* file stores the information of the Ridge Regression model trained via cross-validation, with the randomization seed of 1.

The *regressionLR-cvResult.RData* file stores the information of the Lasso Regression model trained via cross-validation, with the randomization seed of 1.

The *regressionPCR-cvResult.RData* file stores the information of the Principal Component Regression model trained via cross-validation, with the randomization seed of 1.

The *regressionPLSR-cvResult.RData* file stores the information of the Partial Least Squares Regression model trained via cross-validation, with the randomization seed of 1.
