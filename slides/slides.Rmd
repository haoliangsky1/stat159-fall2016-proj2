## Introduction
These are the accompanying slides to our project which bears the same title.

In the following slides, we would introduce the data set, goal, methods, results and conclusions for the project.

## Data
The data for this project, the [Credit](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv) come from the generous contribution of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.


|Predictor|Predictor|Response|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Quantitative|Qualitative|Quantitative|
|Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age, Education|Gender, Student, Married, Ethnicity|Balance|


## Goal
The goal of this project is thus to choose and fit a regression model in order to predict the *Balance* of any new client with the above information as input.

## Methods
The regression methods that we will use in this project include:

* Ordianry Linear Squares (OLS)

### Shrinkage Methods

- Ridge Regression (RR)
  
- Lasso Regression (LR)

### Dimensional Reduction Methods

- Principal Components Regression (PCR)
  
- Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)


## Shrinkage Methods:
### Ridge Regression
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_{j}x_{ij})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_{j}^{2} = RSS  + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_{j}^{2} $$

### Lasso Regression
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_{i} - \beta_{0} - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_{j}x_{ij})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p}|\beta_{j}| = RSS + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p}|\beta_{j}|$$


## Dimensional Reduction Methods:
### Principal Components Regression

### Partial Least Squares Regression

## Cross-validation (CV)
A method for tuning parameters used in




## Results
### Ridge vs. Lasso

### PCR vs. PLSR

## Conclusions
In the end, we may conclude that 

## After Thoughts
In the analysis, we also realized that ....

Therefore, in the future,
